This repository includes MATLAB live scripts used to train new undergraduate researchers in using ordinary differential equations to describe population and mass balances for cells and chemical species in mathematical models for chemical and biological systems.

[Write_system_of_ODEs.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/UGResearch/blob/master/Write_system_of_ODEs.mlx) introduces material balances through the acronym IOGA for In â€“ Out + Generation = Accumulation. A worked example of a system of ODEs is provided. Students can use this interactive coding template to solve numerous ODEs from chemical engineering or mathematical biology.

[Intro_to_Bio_ODEs.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/UGResearch/blob/master/Intro_to_Bio_ODEs.mlx) reproduces the results of Figure 7 of  dePillis, Gu, and Radunskaya (2006).

[dePillisSoln.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/UGResearch/blob/master/dePillisSoln.mlx) is a partial solution for the dePillis, Gu, and Radunskaya (2006) model. The purposes of this exercise are for students to encounter issues with reproducible research computing and to gain practice with editing interactive coding templates to simulate other equations, parameter values, or conditions.
